# My MySQL DBA & DevOps Learning Roadmap

This repository tracks my journey from beginner to a professional MySQL Database Administrator and DevOps specialist.

---

## Phase 1: The Absolute Fundamentals  —Ñ—É–Ω–¥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç (The Foundation)

The goal of this phase is to build a solid foundation. I will understand what MySQL is, how to install it, how to speak its language (SQL), and how to perform the most basic administrative tasks.

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Core Concepts & Terminology

- [x] **Goal:** Understand the "what" and "why" before the "how".
- **Key Skills:**
  - [ ] Define what a **Database** is (the digital filing cabinet).
  - [ ] Define what an **RDBMS** is (the system managing the cabinets).
  - [ ] Explain the difference between **MySQL** and **SQL**.
  - [ ] Understand the structure: `Table`, `Row` (Record), and `Column` (Field).
  - [ ] Explain the concept of a **Primary Key** (a unique ID for each row).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Installation & First Contact

- [ ] **Goal:** Get a working MySQL server and connect to it.
- **Key Skills:**
  - [ ] Install **MySQL Community Server** on my operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux).
  - [ ] Install a **GUI Tool** like `MySQL Workbench` or `DBeaver`.
  - [ ] Learn to start and stop the MySQL service.
  - [ ] Successfully connect to the local MySQL server using both the command line and the GUI tool.
  - [ ] Locate the primary configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`).

### Ì∑£Ô∏è Step 3: The Language - Basic SQL

- [ ] **Goal:** Learn the essential SQL commands to interact with data. This is how we talk to the database.
- **Key Skills:**
  - [ ] **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Commands that define the structure.
    - [ ] `CREATE DATABASE`
    - [ ] `CREATE TABLE`
  - [ ] **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Commands that manage the data itself.
    - [ ] `INSERT` (add new rows)
    - [ ] `SELECT` (read/query data)
    - [ ] `UPDATE` (change existing rows)
    - [ ] `DELETE` (remove rows)
  - [ ] **Filtering Data:**
    - [ ] `SELECT` with the `WHERE` clause.

### Ì∑ÇÔ∏è Step 4: Database & Table Management

- [ ] **Goal:** Learn how an admin creates and manages the database structure.
- **Key Skills:**
  - [ ] Design a simple two-table database (e.g., `authors` and `books`).
  - [ ] Choose correct **Data Types** for columns (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `DATE`).
  - [ ] Use `CREATE TABLE` with proper data types and a `PRIMARY KEY`.
  - [ ] Use `ALTER TABLE` to add a new column to an existing table.
  - [ ] Use `DROP TABLE` and `DROP DATABASE` (and understand how dangerous they are!).
  - [ ] Understand how to see all databases and tables on the server.
    ```sql
    -- Example Admin Commands
    SHOW DATABASES;
    USE my_new_database;
    SHOW TABLES;
    DESCRIBE my_table_name; -- Shows the structure of a table
    ```
